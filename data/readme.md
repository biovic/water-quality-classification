Pakistan_river.csv has been updated to modified_pakistan_river.csv
The reason is:
Some of convertion using "camelot"[install using pip] are undefinable. Due to its, some of the data need to be changed during computation in WaterQuality.ipynb or WaterQuality.py, which when data are NaN, we have to convert them into 0 or something quantifiable (Condition and definable)
